    "1. Imagine a d-t graph where time is on the x axis and distance on the y axis.\n",
    "2. A point on this graph represents the displacement from the origin. (or distance if its a straight line)\n",
    "3. Velocity is how much displacement is happening in 1 second\n",
    "-- Avg velocity: change in displacement over a time interval \n",
    "(u could have covered a distance of 1000m coz of different turns but if ur displacement is 10m then that will be taken wrt to the total time taken)\n",
    "avg velocity of 10m/s means every second we cover 10m\n",
    "-- Instantaneous velocity: what is the change in displacement at this moment. ofcourse this is a lil meaningless without a reference point.\n",
    "So at point x, we take x+h as our reference point. h here is tiny and close to 0.\n",
    "Instantaneous velocity at x = lim h->0 f(x+h)-f(x)/x+h-x\n",
    "if time changes slightly, find out how much displacement is happening and divide that by the smol time diff to get the rate of change/velocity. \n",
    "this gives us the best approximation for the velocity around that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If f(x)=x, for x = 2, \n",
    "y = 2, we have covered 2m\n",
    "dy/dx=1, y is changing by 1m/s around x = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "now, if f(x)=x^2, at x = 2\n",
    "y = 4, we have covered 4m\n",
    "dy/dx = 4, y is changing by 4m/s around x = 2\n",
    "So if we go from x = 2 to x = 3, then on the *tangent line*, displacement will increase by +4\n",
    "on f(x) however, as we go from x=2 to x=3, the displacement happening at x = 3, will be given by f(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "tldr: derivative is an approx of the rate of change of a function at a point\n",
    "that we get by nudging the input a tiny bit and seeing how much the output changes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How this applies in deep learning:\n",
    "- we compute the derivative of the loss function wrt all of its weights\n",
    "- this tells us how much the loss fn changes by if we change the weights by a tiny amount.\n",
    "- then we adjust weights accordingly \n",
